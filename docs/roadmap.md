# Go-Insight: Application Roadmap

## Overview

Go-Insight is an observability platform designed to collect, store, and visualize metrics, logs, and traces from distributed applications. This roadmap outlines the planned development phases to transform the current foundation into a comprehensive observability solution.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current State)

- ✅ Basic API implementation for logs collection and retrieval
- ✅ Basic API implementation for metrics collection and retrieval
- ✅ Database schema for logs, metrics, traces, and spans
- ✅ Docker setup for local development

## Phase 2: Enhanced Core Features (1-2 months)

### API Improvements
- Complete validation for all endpoints
- Implement filtering, pagination, and sorting for GET endpoints
- Add bulk insertion endpoints for high-volume data
- Create aggregation endpoints for metrics analysis

### Tracing Implementation
- Complete trace and span creation endpoints
- Implement distributed tracing with context propagation
- Add relationship queries between logs, metrics, and traces

### Data Management
- Implement data retention policies
- Add data compression for long-term storage
- Create database indexes for query optimization

## Phase 3: User Interface (2-3 months)

### Dashboard Development
- Create a web UI for visualizing metrics
- Implement log viewer with search and filter capabilities
- Design trace visualization with span relationships
- Add customizable dashboards for different service views

### Alerting System
- Define alert conditions and thresholds
- Implement notification channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
- Create alert history and management interface

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (3-4 months)

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement user authentication system
- Add role-based access control
- API key management for service authentication

### SDK Development
- Create client libraries for popular languages:
  - Go SDK
  - Node.js SDK
  - Python SDK
  - Java SDK

### Advanced Analytics
- Implement anomaly detection
- Add service dependency mapping
- Create performance benchmarking tools

## Phase 5: Enterprise Features (4-6 months)

### Scaling & Performance
- Implement data sharding for high-volume environments
- Add support for distributed deployment
- Optimize query performance for large datasets

### Integration Ecosystem
- Add integrations with popular services:
  - Kubernetes monitoring
  - Cloud provider metrics (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Popular frameworks and databases

### Advanced Tracing
- Implement sampling strategies
- Add support for OpenTelemetry protocol
- Create service topology visualization

## Phase 6: Deployment & Distribution (Ongoing)

### Deployment Options
- Docker Compose setup for small deployments
- Kubernetes Helm charts for scalable deployments
- Cloud marketplace offerings

### Documentation & Examples
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Deployment guides for different environments
- Integration examples for common frameworks
- Best practices for observability

### Community Building

- Contribution guidelines

## Future Considerations

- Machine learning for predictive analytics
- Business intelligence integrations
- Custom query language for complex analysis
- High-availability configuration for critical environments
- Event correlation across multiple observability signals

## Success Metrics
